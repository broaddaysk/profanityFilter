# profanityFilter
a comprehensive language filter

case insensitive; handles special chars, substrings, l33tsp34k, space-separation, and all phonetically identical cases via double-metaphone algorithm. double-metaphone is primarily used to handle alternate spellings of banned words in text-only form, but is also powerful enough to handle text-to-speech filtering
